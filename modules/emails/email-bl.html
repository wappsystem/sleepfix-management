            <p>Welcome to SleepFix. Before you begin the program, we invite you to complete your first set of
questionnaires. These questionnaires will provide us with valuable information regarding your
current sleep and wellbeing. We will use this to compare your study data as you track along which
will inform us if SleepFix therapy is working for you.</p>
<p>It should take approximately 10 minutes to complete. Once you have completed these
questionnaires, we will send you an email shortly after which will have further instructions on how
to download the application and get started with SleepFix.</p>
