                            You are invited to take part in a research study for people with insomnia. In this study, we aim to treat people with insomnia through sleep consolidation therapy delivered via SleepFix, a smartphone application. The study aims to improve sleep and wellbeing and will help inform the further development of the smartphone application.
                            <br><br>Everyone who participants in this study will be given access to SleepFix on their smartphone. You will use the program for 3 weeks, with or without a Fitbit (depending on which group you are assigned) and have another 3 weeks access to the app if you feel that you want to engage in the therapy for longer. We will ask you to complete online questionnaires at start of the study, weekly (for 3 weeks), after 6 weeks and 12 weeks.
                            <br><br><b>Why have I been invited to participate in this study?</b>
                            <br>This study may be suitable for you because you have insomnia which could benefit from this intervention. The SleepFix app has been designed to personalise the sleep therapy for individuals to improve sleep using sleep consolidation therapy.
                            <br><br><b>What are the aims of this study?</b>
                            <br>We would like to find out if SleepFix improves sleep, daytime functioning and mood. Sleep consolidation therapy is a clinically-proven therapy for insomnia. The SleepFix app allows people to engage with the therapy without the need for a Sleep Psychologist. SleepFix will ask participants to limit their time in bed to how much sleep time they are currently achieving. You will be prescribed a new bedtime and rising time for the duration of the treatment component (3 weeks).
                            <br><br><b>Do I have to participate?</b>
                            <br>No, it is entirely up to you whether you wish to participate in the study. If you do take part, you may withdraw at any time without having to give a reason. It is best to discuss the study with friends or family prior to consent. If you decide to terminate your participation in this study please notify the SleepFix Research Team on 02 9114 0481 (Telephone) or at Woolcock.sleepfix@sydney.edu.au (Email).
                            <br><br><b>What does this study involve?</b>
                            <br>This study will be delivered completely online, there are no face-to-face visits required. Please read the information below to better understand what the study involves.
                            <br><br><b><i>i. Providing consent and completing questionnaires</i></b>
                            <br>If you agree to participate, you will be asked to provide consent electronically (next page) and complete your first set of questionnaires (which will take approximately 20 minutes). You will also be randomly selected to receive a Fitbit wearable device to track your sleep. If you already have a Fitbit device you will need to tell us and you can use it during the study.
                            <br><br><b><i>ii. Getting started</i></b>
                            <br>We will ask you to watch a number of short instructional videos about SleepFix, how the treatment works and how to use the app. Following this, you will be provided with the instructions of how to download the SleepFix app.
                            <br><br><b><i>iii. Using SleepFix</i></b>
                            <br>Once you have installed SleepFix on your phone, you will need to set up the program. This involves a short series of questions about your current sleep pattern and what you think you can achieve during the therapy. You will be asked to use the app for 3 weeks, with a further 3 weeks of optional usage. However, it is up to you how much you use the app on a daily basis. It will only take approximately 5 minutes each day to complete the sleep diary entries in the SleepFix app, needed to check your progress. We will ask you to wear the Fitbit wristband for 3 weeks (only if selected to randomly receive the device). You can continue using SleepFix following the 3 weeks of the treatment.
                            <br><br><b><i>iv. Completing questionnaires during the study</i></b>
                            <br>Throughout the study, you will be reminded to complete weekly online questionnaires. The questionnaires will ask about your sleep, daytime functioning, mood and your experience with SleepFix. We will ask you to complete these online at the following timepoints:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Each week for the first 3 weeks (5 minutes each time)</li>
                                <li>At week 6 (20 minutes)</li>
                                <li>Final questionnaires at week 12 (20 minutes)</li>
                            </ul>

Any information obtained in connection with this research study is re-identifiable and confidential. Data from individiuals who have completed the initial screening questionnaires but were ineligible will be deleted.
                            <br><br>All data collected will be anonymised using a code number when you consent to participate in the study. The key linking your identity to your participant code will be stored online in a password protected manner on a secure server. This ensures your data will remain anonymous. Access to your data will only be granted to the research personnel and data will be held for a minimum of 15 years, as per policy. As this study is part of the Cooperative Research Centre for Alertness, Safety and Productivity, re-identifiable data (i.e. study results from which identifiers have been removed and replaced by a code, but it remains possible to re-identify a specific individual) may be shared with research collaborators of the Cooperative Research Centre for Alertness, Safety and Productivity (www.alertnesscrc.com). Data will not be shared without permission of Principal Investigators of the current project. All data available for sharing will be stored on a web-based database located in Australia. Re-identifiable data may be retained indefinitely by the Cooperative Research Centre for Alertness, Safety and Productivity. Your data may also be made available to a third party in the future other than the Cooperative Research Centre for Alertness, Safety and Productivity, in which case further ethical approval would be sought from both yourself and the Ethics Review Committee.
                            <br><br><b>How will the results of the study be shared?</b>
                            <br>The results will be published in academic journals and presented at conferences. Any data published in scientific journals will not be able to identify you.

This is an Australian Government Initiative that brings together industry, government, and university sectors in a coordinated program. The major aim of the CRC is to reduce the burden of impaired alertness on the safety, productivity and health of Australians. The Alertness CRC will develop and deploy the next generation of shift scheduling and workplace design techniques; alertness assessment devices; individualised programs for better sleep health; and, a range of innovative strategies to reduce fatigue. As the study sponsor, the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research will provide non-financial support as it will not charge the study for this service.
